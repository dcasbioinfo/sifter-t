Introduction
============

Sifter-T is a easy to use framework for "Sifter2.0" large scale automation. 

"Sifter2.0" is a tool for probabilistic functional annotation, wich relies on 
phylogenetic structure for Gene Ontology annotations propagation. 

Sifter-T expands "Sifter2.0" usability, scalability and functionality:
    - Accepts nucleotide and aminoacid as inputs
    - Multithreading
    - Easy to use

If you use Sifter-T in work contributing to a sientific publication, we ask 
that you cite our application note:

Installation and Usage
======================

Installation should be as simple as going to the Sifter-T extracted directory
and running the main script:
    
    $ python sifter-t.py -t XX -f FILE -o DIR -d DIR -s DIR -i CODE [options]

Alternatively you can use independent scripts (in order):

  * Check main parameters, files and create "options.pk" for other scripts usage:
    $ python param_chk_00.py -t XX -f FILE -o DIR -d DIR -s DIR -i CODE [options]

  * Protein Family multiple alignment generation:
    $ python ntaapfam_01.py -d DIR

  * Annotation recovery and ".pli" files preparation:
    $ python recann_02.py -d DIR

  * Gene tree preparation:
    $ python gentree_03.py -d DIR

  * Species tree preparation and reconcilation process:
    $ python reconciliation_04.py -d DIR

  * Automation of the inference engine execution:
    $ python runsifter_05.py -d DIR

  * Summarizes results from Sifter-T's workflow:
    $ python results_06.py -d DIR


Typical usage
=============

* Running "sifter-t.py -h" (help) the software shows:

---------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------
Usage: 
 	sifter-t.py -t XX -f FILE -o DIR -d DIR -s DIR -i CODE [options]

This script reads a nucleotide or protein multifasta FILE, translates in 6
frames, identifies the PFAM ids associated to each frame, build a tree based
on PFAM alignments and evidence codes, run SIFTER to propagate information
from families annotated to families of interest and returns a list of
annotations and his probabilities.

  The file must be composed of nucleotide sequences in multifasta format, with nucleotides 
  representations according to IUPAC nucleotide codes.

     we removed the Eucariotes (2759) branch.>

Output Stucture
===============

 * The "REPORT.tab" is a "Tab Separated Values" file with 2 blocks of information:
        1 - Header
        2 - Annotated genes

    Collumns: <Gene Name> <reading frame> <aminoacid start position> 
    <aminoacid stop position> <PFam code> <probability> <GO Code> <GO Name>
    
    Gene Name - are returned in the same order as input.

    Reading Frame - Uses the Watson/Crick notation
        c - Crick - sense strand
        w - Watson- antisense strand
        1, 2, 3 - The reading frame

    Start/Stop position - For nucleotides or aminoacid inputs, it shows the 
    begining and the end of an aminoacid region (result of reading frame 
    translation or not) with identified Protein Family.
        
    PFam Code - The code for the Protein Family identified at this region.

    Probability - Sifter2.0 returns a list of probabilities for a list of
    functions. Sifter-T shows only the functions (according to GO) with
    probabilities above the cutoff. The probability can be read as "The 
    probability of the identified domain have the function [name of the
    function] given the Protein Family structure and annotations. Sometimes  
    you can find probabilities "0.999999999999". It means that this 
    particular Protein Family have only one GO number annotated along the tree,
    so the probability of the identified domain have the function X, given that
    this is the only function on the tree, is almost 1.

    GO Code - The Gene Ontology code for the annotated function.
    
    GO Name - The Gene Ontology full name for the annotated GO code.


 * The "REPORT.txt" file have 5 blocks of information:
        1 - Header
        2 - Genes without associated protein family - Sifter can not
            annotate those genes
        2 - Genes in families without a single annotation - Sifter can not
            annotate those genes
        3 - Families with annotations, but none among the selected evidence  
            codes. Sifter can annotate if you include other evidence codes.
        4 - Annotated genes
  
    - The annotated genes shows the follloing structure for aminoacid input:

    [gene name]
    	[start position]-[stop position] - [protein family code]
    		PROB_MAX	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MID	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MIN	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION

    - And this structure for nucleotide input:

    [gene name]
    	[reading frame] - [start pos]-[stop pos] - [protein family code]
    		PROB_MAX	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MID	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MIN	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION

    - The report for Protein Families as inputs uses the same basic structure as 
      the REPORT_alt.txt for other types of input:

    [protein family code]
        [gene name]
    		PROB_MAX	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MID	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MIN	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION


 * The "REPORT_alt.txt" file (just for aa and nt inputs) have 2 blocks of information:
        1 - Header
        2 - Annotated genes

    The annotated genes shows the follloing structure for aminoacid input:
    [protein family code]
        [gene name]|[start position]-[stop position] 
    		PROB_MAX	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MID	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MIN	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION

    And this structure for nucleotide input:
    [protein family code]
        [gene name]|[reading frame]|[start position]-[stop position] 
    		PROB_MAX	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MID	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION
    		PROB_MIN	GO	GO_DESCRIPTION



Testing
=======

Sifter2.0 was compared with Sifter1.1 through a hundred families dataset.
This dataset is available at <http://sifter.berkeley.edu/>.

You can use Sifter-T to reproduce the "hundred families dataset". 
For this you must download the Sifter-T needed files from the following databases:
    * Pfam v24: <ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/releases/Pfam24.0/>
    * GOA v80: <ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/GO/goa/old/UNIPROT/>
    * GO 2010-03-01: <http://www.geneontology.org/ontology-archive/gene_ontology_edit.obo.2010-03-01.gz>
    * NCBI Taxonomy (OBO format): Latest version.

After downloading and extracting the database files you must prepare them:

    $ python dbprep.py -d DIR

And then you can run Sifter-T using the ready-to-use "hundred_families_site.txt" file 
included in the package:

    $ python sifter-t.py -t pf -f test/hundred_families_site.txt -o [output folder] -d [database directory] -s [sifter2.0 directory] -i EXP_ALL

There is another version of the huundred families dataset in "test" folder. If you
download from the supplemental material of "Sifter2.0" paper, there are some minor 
differences between it and the website version. Both "hundred families dataset" are 
included in "test" folder.
In the end you will find some subdirectories inside [output folder]. Each 
subdirectory is named regarding a protein family, and have a set of intermediate
files. The files "PF_____.nhx" and "PF_____.pli" for each family must be equivalent
to the same files in the hundred families dataset from sifter2.0 website.

You can go further and build REPORT files for the original "hundred families dataset".
For this you should replace the builded files for the original ones. I've included a 
script to help you in this task:

    $ python hundred_families_test.py -i [original] -o [builded]

It removes the Sifter2.0 annotation files for the builded hundred families output
directory and rename "REPORT.tab" and "REPORT.txt" to "old_REPORT.tab" and
"old_REPORT.txt". Next, you must run the script that automates Sifter2.0 annotation:

    $ python runsifter_05.py -d [output dir]

And last, create again the report files:

    $ python results_06.py -d [output dir]
    
Now you can easily compare the original and the builded annotations.
